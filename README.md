## üìö Detailed Usage Guide

### üîç Basic Celo Operations

#### Checking Address Balances

**Example 1: View all token balances for an address**

```
What's the balance of this Celo address: 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a?
```

Claude will respond with:
```
CELO Balance: 42.561 CELO
cUSD Balance: 15.75 cUSD
cEUR Balance: 0.00 cEUR
```

**Example 2: Check a specific token balance**

```
How much cUSD does 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a have?
```

#### Viewing Transaction History

**Example: See recent transactions**

```
Show me the last 5 transactions for 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a
```

Claude will display:
```
Recent transactions for 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a:

```

### üí∏ Sending Transactions

#### Sending CELO

**Example: Send CELO to another address**

```
I want to send 0.5 CELO to 0x123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789
```

Claude will guide you through the process:

1. First, it will create a transaction session:
   ```
   Created a new transaction session. This session will expire in 5 minutes.
   ```

2. Then ask for your private key:
   ```
   To proceed with sending CELO, please provide your private key.
   Note: Your private key will be stored temporarily in memory and will be cleared after the transaction or after 5 minutes.
   ```

3. After you provide your private key, it will confirm transaction details:
   ```
   Preparing to send 0.5 CELO to 0x123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789
   Current gas price: 0.000000025 CELO
   Estimated transaction fee: 0.00052 CELO
   Total amount (including fee): 0.50052 CELO
   
   Would you like to proceed with this transaction? (yes/no)
   ```

4. Upon confirmation, it will submit and report the status:
   ```
   Transaction submitted successfully!
   Transaction hash: 0x9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef
   You can view this transaction on the Celo Explorer: https://explorer.celo.org/tx/0x9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef
   
   Your transaction session has been cleared for security.
   ```

#### Sending Stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR)

**Example: Send cUSD to another address**

```
I need to send 5 cUSD to 0x123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789
```

The process is similar to sending CELO, with Claude guiding you through each step.

### üìà Aave DeFi Operations

#### Supplying Assets to Earn Interest

**Example: Supply CELO to Aave**

```
I want to supply 2 CELO to Aave to earn interest
```

Claude will guide you through:

1. Creating an Aave session:
   ```
   Created a new Aave session. This session will expire in 5 minutes.
   ```

2. Requesting your private key:
   ```
   To proceed with supplying CELO to Aave, please provide your private key.
   Note: Your private key will be stored temporarily in memory and will be cleared after the operation or after 5 minutes.
   ```

3. Showing current rates and confirming:
   ```
   Current Aave deposit APY for CELO: 2.45%
   Preparing to supply 2 CELO to Aave
   Estimated gas fee: 0.00062 CELO
   
   Would you like to proceed? (yes/no)
   ```

4. Upon confirmation, submitting the transaction:
   ```
   Transaction submitted successfully!
   Transaction hash: 0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc123def456
   You can view this transaction on the Celo Explorer: https://explorer.celo.org/tx/0xabc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc123def456abc123def456
   
   You have successfully supplied 2 CELO to Aave. You will now start earning interest at the current rate of 2.45% APY.
   Your Aave session has been cleared for security.
   ```

#### Borrowing Against Your Collateral

**Example: Borrow USDC using CELO as collateral**

```
I want to borrow 10 USDC against my CELO collateral on Aave
```

Claude will:

1. Check if you have enough collateral:
   ```
   Checking your Aave position...
   
   Your current deposits:
   - 5 CELO (worth approximately $25.00)
   
   Collateral Status:
   - CELO: Enabled as collateral
   
   Borrowing power: $12.50 (at 50% LTV)
   Current borrowing: $0.00
   Available to borrow: $12.50
   ```

2. Guide you through the borrowing process similar to the supply process.

#### Repaying Your Loans

**Example: Repay borrowed USDC**

```
I want to repay 5 USDC to Aave
```

Claude will guide you through the repayment process, showing your current loans and helping you submit the transaction.

### üìä Dune Analytics for Governance

#### Viewing Active Governance Proposals

**Example: Check active CGPs**

```

Celo Explorer MCP takes several measures to ensure your security:

- **Private keys are never stored on disk** - only temporarily in memory
- **Sessions automatically expire** after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Sessions are cleared** after each transaction or operation
- You can **manually clear sessions** at any time with simple commands:
  ```
  Clear my transaction session
  ```
  or
  ```
  Clear my Aave session
  ```
